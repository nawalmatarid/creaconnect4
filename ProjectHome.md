Project given for the Christmas holiday by the school Cr√©ajeux.

Project in C++ with the library SFML 1.3.

It's a simple Connect4 with bonus (bomb, swap, double).

WARNING : It's not build with the static SFML, so you have to have the SFML library in your directory before launching the game. I'll make a static version later.
